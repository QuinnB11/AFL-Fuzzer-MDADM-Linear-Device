# CMPSC311-HonorsOption#

Using AFL, we can fuzz the MDADM Linear Device that we have created in class to see the bugs and point to fixes that can be made. 

## Requirements ## 

We must first download AFL++ at the repository:
[https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus)
