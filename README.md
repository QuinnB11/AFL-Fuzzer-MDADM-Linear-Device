# CMPSC311-HonorsOption
Schryer Honors Option Project for CMPSC311 by Quinn Butcher 


## What this Project does ##
Using AFL, we can fuzz the MDADM Linear Device that we have created in class to see the bugs and point to fixes that can be made. This project also includes a report about the AFL++ findings for each project, the fixes that can be made such these errors occur less or not at all, and updates to AFL++ that could be helpful in fuzzign better. 


## Requirements ## 

We must first download AFL++ at the repository:
[https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) 

and put this repository in the CMPSC311-HonorsOption Directory. You can follow the provided link to learn about installtion of AFL++.


## Running of AFL ##
